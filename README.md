Fizz Buzz React App

### `ABOUT PROJECT`
Project is created using react components that show the numbers from 1 to a limit that is specified by a prop (e.g. 100).
The numbers should be translated as follows:
	1. For multiples of 3 return "Fizz"
	2. For multiples of 5 return "Buzz"
	3. For multiples of 3 and 5 return "FizzBuzz"
	4. If none of the other rules apply, return the number itself
HOC in created that accepts your main component and the FizzBuzz data and displays result. Also render prop to render the translated numbers is implemented.
